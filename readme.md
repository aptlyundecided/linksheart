# Links Heart!

Intended as a sweet valentines day gift, this code will be the 'engine' that powers a physical heart that is divided into two halves like in the Legend Of Zelda.

Two phones will be linked to the system.  One phone assigned to each half. When the MAC Addresses of the two phones are detected on the network, then both halves will light up.  If only one is detected, only the light for that specific heart half will light up.
